  description: Earth (1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi) from the Sun) is the largest
    and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological
    activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.[99] Its liquid hydrosphere
    is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
    tectonics has been observed.[100] Earth's atmosphere is radically different from
    those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain
    21% free oxygen.[101][102] The planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from
    solar and cosmic radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining habitability.[103]
    It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial
    planet in the Solar System.
