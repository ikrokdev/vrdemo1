  description: Mercury (0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from the Sun) is the
    closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 MEarth),
    Mercury has no natural satellites. The dominant geological features are impact
    craters or basins with ejecta blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity
    including magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced
    by a period of contraction early in the planet's history.[89] Mercury's very
    tenuous atmosphere consists of solar-wind particles trapped by Mercury's magnetic
    field, as well as atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.[90][91] Its
    relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained.
    Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact,
    or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.[92][93]
