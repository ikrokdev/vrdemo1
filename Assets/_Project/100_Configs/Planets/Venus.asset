  planetName: Venus
  position: 2
  description: "Venus (0.7 AU (100 million km; 65 million mi) from the Sun) is close
    in size to Earth (0.815 MEarth) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle
    around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological
    activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as
    dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface
    temperatures over 400 \xB0C (752 \xB0F), mainly due to the amount of greenhouse
    gases in the atmosphere.[96] The planet has no magnetic field that would prevent
    depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is
    being replenished by volcanic eruptions.[97] A relatively young planetary surface
    displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity, but is devoid of plate tectonics.
    It may undergo resurfacing episodes on a time scale of 700 million years.[98]"
