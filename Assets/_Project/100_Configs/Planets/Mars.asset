  description: Mars (1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun) is smaller
    than Earth and Venus (0.107 MEarth). It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide
    with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg); roughly 0.6%
    of that of Earth but sufficient to support weather phenomena.[104] Its surface,
    peppered with volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles
    Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently
    as 2 million years ago.[105] Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its
    soil.[106] Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to
    be either captured asteroids,[107] or ejected debris from a massive impact early
    in Mars's history.[108]
